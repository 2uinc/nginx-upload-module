Version 2.0.4
 * Fixed bug: location configuration of upload_set_form_field and upload_pass_form_field
   was not inheritable from server configuration.
 * Added feature: directive upload_aggregate_form_field to pass aggragate properties
   of a file like file size, MD5 and SHA1 sums to backend.
 * Fixed bug: missing CRLF at the end of resulting body.
 * Change: optimized out some unnecessary memory allocations and zeroeing.

Version 2.0.3
 * upload_store directive was not able to receive more than one argument.
   As a result no hashed dirs for file uploads were possible.
 * upload_store_access directive did not work at all. Permissions were
   defaulted to user:rw. Thanks to Brian Moran.

   was generated intead of 400 Bad Request and 503 Service Unavailable.
 * Fixed copyrights for temporary file name generation code

 * Added feasible debug logging
 * Added support for variables to generate form fields
   in resulting request body
 * Added missing logging of errno after write failures
